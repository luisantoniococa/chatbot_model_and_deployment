# Chatbot Model and Deployment
##  Background
One of the principal problems I encounter when scheduling with a small contractor is sometimes the comunication issues when messaging and communicating with this person. I propose to solve this problem by creating a chatbot that will help providin useful information and connect to a calendar app to set a calendar for privates and different events. 

**This project is in continuous improvment and its main goal is to serve better to the latin dance community**

Created a chatbot to solve some scheduling and business problems and deploy in the google cloud plataform,
also the model is going is going to use rasa as a plataform where the natural language understanding will perform the intent recognition. 
The model is going to use twilio for the basic texting base and it will connect to a database designed to save clients data in postgreSQL
Further we are going to retrain the model with the user test chats using the Rasa-X plataform. We are going to create a container for this model and eventually run it in docker.
